      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h> This project is designed by Prof. Yvette Shen and Prof. Han-Wei Shen 
          for Design and CSE student to collaborate together. </h>
      <h2>Project Statement</h2>
      <h>Although there have been large amounts of research on the subject of global 
          warming, there are still not enough personal and societal action is being 
          taken to reduce the effect of the phenomenon. Climate change is gradual, 
          so it is difficult for people to conceptualize the urgency of the problem. 
          We will show how precipitation and temperature have changed over 
          the last 100 years to affect Ohio specifically. The purpose of this 
          visualization is to show precipitation and temperature change in an easy 
          to understand and interactive format to inspire change to protect the environment 
          in our local Ohio communities.</h>
	  <h2>Our Project</h2>
      <h>This interactive website shows the climate change that the state of Ohio has gone through 
	     in the past 100 years. We have used the visualization library D3 to display the state 
		 of Ohio and data from the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration. The user
		 can slide through past century with a movable bar and directly see how temperature and
		 precipitation have changed. This interactive website should make it clear to any user
		 the real effects climate change has had on their home state, and help to motivate them
		 to change their lifestyles to reduce further damage to the environment.</h>
