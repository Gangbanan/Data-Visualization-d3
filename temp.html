				<p>Although there have been large amounts of research on the subject of global 
			  warming, there are still not enough personal and societal action is being 
			  taken to reduce the effect of the phenomenon. Climate change is gradual, 
			  so it is difficult for people to conceptualize the urgency of the problem. 
			  We will show how precipitation, temperature, and wind flow have changed over 
			  the last 100 years to affect Ohio specifically. The purpose of this 
			  visualization is to show precipitation, temperature, and wind data in an easy 
			  to understand and interactive format to inspire change to protect the environment 
			  in our local Ohio communities.</p>
