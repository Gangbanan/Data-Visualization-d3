CSE-5544-Geology

This is a group project for CSE 5544

Problem Statement:
Although there has been large amounts of research into the subject of global warming, not enough personal and societal action is being taken to reduce the effect of the phenomenon. The climate change is gradual, so it is hard for people to conceptualize the urgency of the problem. We will show how precipitation annd temperature have changed over the last 100 years to affect Ohio specifically. The purpose of this visualization is to show precipitation and temperature data in an easy to understand and interactive format to inspire change to protect the environment in our local Ohio communities.
