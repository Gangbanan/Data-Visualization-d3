				<h2 class="about-title">Introduction</h2>
				<p> This project is designed by Prof. Yvette Shen and Prof. Han-Wei Shen 
				for Design and CSE students to collaborate together. </p>
				<h2 class="about-title">Project Statement</h2>
				<p>Although there have been large amounts of research on the subject of global 
				warming, there are still not enough personal and societal action is being 
				taken to reduce the effect of the phenomenon. Climate change is gradual, 
				so it is difficult for people to conceptualize the urgency of the problem. 
				We will show how precipitation and temperature have changed over 
				the last 100 years to affect Ohio specifically. The purpose of this 
				visualization is to show precipitation and temperature change in an easy 
				to understand and interactive format to inspire change to protect the environment 
				in our local Ohio communities.</p>
				<h2 class="about-title">Our Project</h2>
				<p>This interactive website shows the climate change that the state of Ohio has gone through 
				in the past 100 years. We have used the visualization library D3 to display the state of Ohio 
				and data from the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration. The user can slide through
				past century with a movable bar and directly see how temperature and precipitation have changed. 
				This interactive website should make it clear to any user the real effects climate change has had 
				on their home state, and help to motivate them to change their lifestyles to reduce further damage 
				to the environment.</p>
